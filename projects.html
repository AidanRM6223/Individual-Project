                <h1>Project 1: Tank N' Blocks</h1>
                <p>This was a game made at DigiPen's Pre-College Program in 2018. I had help from a team of three other students that were in the same program as me, and our goal was to create a top down shooter. We came up with "Tank N' Blocks," a game where you control a tank to push boxes into their designated slots to advance through the levels. At the same time, you have to use power-ups and the ability to shoot bullets to destroy other tanks.</p>

                        <li>It was my first time working with a team to make a video game</li>
                        <li>How to make a good game in a small amount of time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Things we could've done better:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Well, if we had an actual artist on our team (and not just a designer), I think our game would’ve been a lot better. We used pixel art made by Kean (a lot of work on his end).</li>
                        <li>We could’ve polished up our code a bit, since most of our game was hard-coded. Up until that point, I never hard-coded my games, but I understood it eventually.</li>

                <p>This project is definitely the biggest game I’ve ever made – my first 2D platformer. The plot is simple: you have to go through levels, gather power-ups to defeat enemies, all in order to get a balloon. Not as interesting as more popular games out there, but I didn't pay much attention to the plotline. I had a lot of fun with this project, as it originally was a prototype for a course I’d taken over the summer, but I built on it to add a couple more levels and more features (the ice level & the Super Turbo power-up).</p>
