                <div>
                    <p>This was a game made at DigiPen's Pre-College Program in 2018. I had help from a team of three other students that were in the same program as me, and our goal was to create a top down shooter. We came up with "Tank N' Blocks," a game where you control a tank to push boxes into their designated slots to advance through the levels. At the same time, you have to use power-ups and the ability to shoot bullets to destroy other tanks.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It was my first time working with a team to make a video game</li>
                            <li>How to make a good game in a small amount of time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Things we could've done better:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Well, if we had an actual artist on our team (and not just a designer), I think our game would’ve been a lot better. We used pixel art made by Kean (a lot of work on his end).</li>
                            <li>We could’ve polished up our code a bit, since most of our game was hard-coded. Up until that point, I never hard-coded my games, but I understood it eventually.</li>

                <h3>Project 2: Quest for the Balloon</h3>
                <div>
                <p>This project is definitely the biggest game I’ve ever made – my first 2D platformer. The plot is simple: you have to go through levels, gather power-ups to defeat enemies, all in order to get a balloon. Not as interesting as more popular games out there, but I didn't pay much attention to the plotline. I had a lot of fun with this project, as it originally was a prototype for a course I’d taken over the summer, but I built on it to add a couple more levels and more features (the ice level & the Super Turbo power-up).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language: Zilch</li>
                    <li>Things I learned:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to teleport a player to a different position in the level with portals. This part was a bit easy to make, but I had a little trouble with linking pairs together, since there were so many in each level.
                        </li>
                        <li>How to use particle effects – This was a small factor in the game. I wanted each aspect of the player’s power-ups to have particles, not just a change of sprites. I thought it looked great!
                        </li>
                        <li>How to use key bindings for cheat codes to activate power-ups. I found this easy to navigate through the level faster, because you can just activate the Fire power-up with a press of a key and "blaze" your way through each level. The codes are revealed to the player when they beat the game.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Things I could've done better:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the background smaller and follow the player everywhere. In the first few levels especially, the mountains were very up close and were blurry. I could’ve made it so that it followed the camera everywhere or some sort of parallax effect.
                        </li>
                        <li>More than one player – I wanted to originally make it a multi-player game for 2 players, but I didn’t know how to make it so that the camera focused on both players at the same time – or a viewport for each player.
                        </li>

                <h3>Project 3: Top Down shooter</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>With more controls and abilities, I think of this as a revamped "Starship Battlefield," a game I made a couple years back. I used the exact same graphics (though a different colored player ship), but the enemies have different functionalities: In the video to the right, the red alien just patrols up and down, the purple ship flies in random directions inside of arena, and the dark blue ship tries to ram into you and shower you with bullets.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Language: Zilch</li>
                        <li>Things I learned:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to get user input on Zero Engine and to call a function when certain keys are pressed</li>
                            <li>How to make power-ups in Zero Engine. I added an “invincibility” function that activates with a cheat code, allowing you to fly faster and ram into enemies, destroying them instantly.
                            </li>
                            <li>Camera functionality!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Things I could’ve done better:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have a space level instead of an enclosed arena for the player to play in with a gray background. That would’ve made it more fun and a little more realistic.
                            </li>
                            <li>More power-ups – maybe a shield power-up like the original SB would’ve had, but more enhanced. Maybe I could’ve added how many bullets you have left and a power-up to increase them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
