                <div>
                    <p>This was a game made at DigiPen's Pre-College Program in 2018. I had help from a team of three
                        other students that were in the same program as me, and our goal was to create a top down
                        shooter. We came up with "Tank N' Blocks," a game where you control a tank to push boxes into
                        their designated slots to advance through the levels. At the same time, you have to use
                        power-ups and the ability to shoot bullets to destroy other tanks.</p>

                        <li>Things I learned:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It was my first time working with a team to make a video game</li>
                            <li>How to make a good game in a small amount of time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Things we could've done better:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Well, if we had an actual artist on our team (and not just a designer), I think our game
                                would’ve been a lot better. We used pixel art made by Kean (a lot of work on his end).
                            </li>
                            <li>We could’ve polished up our code a bit, since most of our game was hard-coded. Up until
                                that point, I never hard-coded my games, but I understood it eventually.</li>

                <h2>Project 2: Quest for the Balloon</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>This project is definitely the biggest game I’ve ever made – my first 2D platformer. The plot is
                        simple: you have to go through levels, gather power-ups to defeat enemies, all in order to get a
                        balloon. Not as interesting as more popular games out there, but I didn't pay much attention to
                        the plotline. I had a lot of fun with this project, as it originally was a prototype for a
                        course I’d taken over the summer, but I built on it to add a couple more levels and more
                        features (the ice level & the Super Turbo power-up).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Language: Zilch</li>
                        <li>Things I learned:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to teleport a player to a different position in the level with portals. This part
                                was a bit easy to make, but I had a little trouble with linking pairs together, since
                                there were so many in each level.
                            </li>
                            <li>How to use particle effects – This was a small factor in the game. I wanted each aspect
                                of the player’s power-ups to have particles, not just a change of sprites. I thought it
                                looked great!
                            </li>
                            <li>How to use key bindings for cheat codes to activate power-ups. I found this easy to
                                navigate through the level faster, because you can just activate the Fire power-up with
                                a press of a key and "blaze" your way through each level. The codes are revealed to the
                                player when they beat the game.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Things I could've done better:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make the background smaller and follow the player everywhere. In the first few levels
                                especially, the mountains were very up close and were blurry. I could’ve made it so that
                                it followed the camera everywhere or some sort of parallax effect.
                            </li>
                            <li>More than one player – I wanted to originally make it a multi-player game for 2 players,
                                but I didn’t know how to make it so that the camera focused on both players at the same
                                time – or a viewport for each player.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <div>
                    <p>With more controls and abilities, I think of this as a revamped "Starship Battlefield," a game I
                        made a couple years back. I used the exact same graphics (though a different colored player
                        ship), but the enemies have different functionalities: In the video to the right, the red alien
                        just patrols up and down, the purple ship flies in random directions inside of arena, and the
                        dark blue ship tries to ram into you and shower you with bullets.
                    </p>

                        <li>Language: Zilch</li>
                        <li>Things I learned:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to get user input on Zero Engine and to call a function when certain keys are
                                pressed</li>
                            <li>How to make power-ups in Zero Engine. I added an “invincibility” function that activates
                                with a cheat code, allowing you to fly faster and ram into enemies, destroying them
                                instantly.

                            <li>Have a space level instead of an enclosed arena for the player to play in with a gray
                                background. That would’ve made it more fun and a little more realistic.
                            </li>
                            <li>More power-ups – maybe a shield power-up like the original SB would’ve had, but more
                                enhanced. Maybe I could’ve added how many bullets you have left and a power-up to
                                increase them.
                            </li>

                            <li>The sprites were a bit bland in the simulation. They were plain colors – red, green,
                                blue, etc.), whereas I could’ve made my own sprites to make things a bit more
                                interesting in terms of visuals and graphics.
                            </li>
                            <li>Add camera functionality – I could only fit so much in the game area that the camera
                                could view without moving it, so it was hard not to go out of bounds. I could’ve added a
                                script that allowed the camera to move slowly left or right depending on where the
                                active ball(s) are.

                <div>
                    <p>This was the first video game that I’ve ever made This game is a simple top-down shooter in
                        space, where you’re trying to survive as long as possible while shooting at oncoming aliens.
                        There were two power-ups that I wanted to implement into the game, but I couldn’t get the
                        results I wanted with it – so I just added a life item that acts as a continue if you lose all
                        your remaining lives.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Added more power-ups and difficulties - The two power ups I wanted to originally add
                                were a shield power-up and a double-barrel gun power-up. If I had figured out how to
                                make those work, then I think it would’ve made the game more fun. I also could’ve added
                                difficulties – easy, medium, and hard… Maybe I could've made the aliens go faster
                                depending on the difficulty.
                            </li>
                            <li>Different levels - Right now, it’s only a space level. What if there was a battle with
                                Mars or some other planet in the background – or on the planet itself? I would’ve needed
                                to add a point where the game actually ends a level, because right now you play until
                                you run out of lives.

                <div>
                    <p>This project was slightly more fun than my Turtle Sketch program, but extremely hard (and long)
                        to make. I had no knowledge of using loops in C++, so the whole program was basically just
                        conditional statements. This program is a variation of the classic game “Hangman,” with a slight
                        twist. Instead of a man, however, it’s a devil – I thought it’d be fun to add horns when the
                        player lost and say that “the devil has risen”.
                    </p>

                        <li>Language: C++</li>
                        <li>Things I learned:</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Thing I could’ve done better:
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use loops - the code was over 800 lines long, and only contained if-else statements. I
                                could've made it extremely shorter by using some sort of loops.</li>
                            <li>Make the player guess different words each time they win a round. Right now, it’s only
                                one word: HANGMAN. If you play it multiple times, you’ll get it right every time,
                                eventually. I could’ve added a list of words that the computer chooses from for the
                                player to guess each round – that would’ve made it more fun.
                            </li>
                            <li>Have it so that the player can guess the letters in any order – you can only guess in
                                order (i.e. H, A, N, G, M, A, N). If you guess “A” when you first start the game, it
                                says you’re incorrect, when the actual hangman game would say that “You guessed: _ A _ _
                                _ A _.”

                                me. I could've added functionality to make it so that no turtle sketchers went out of a
